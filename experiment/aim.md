## Aim 

I/O Programming - Interfacing of LED and Switch

## Objectives  

-	Demonstrate the use of the Arduino Uno microcontroller to control an LED using a push button switch.
-	Explore the functionality of GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins for digital input and output operations.
-	Understand how to interface a push button switch with the Arduino Uno.
-	Learn how to write a simple program to control the LED based on the state of the push button.
-	Gain hands-on experience in controlling output devices (like LEDs) using input signals through microcontroller programming.
